        <img></img>
        <p class="description">Hello, My name is Pranav! I am an 8th grader who resides in the United States. Programming is something that I am very passionate about as you can probably tell. I love being able to solve the problem or boring task with a program. Or it could be for entertainment purposes. Whatever it is, coding is something that I truly enjoy, and am learning more and more of every single day.  </p>
        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>Other than programming, I love to play chess. It is one of my favorite things to do in my free time, and as of today I am have 1380 elo on chess.com. In addition I love to draw, and sketching is something I like to do. Finally I like playing tennis as a sport, and play it with friends.</p>
